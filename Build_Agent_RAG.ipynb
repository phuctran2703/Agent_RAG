For other baselines, the spatiotemporal\\nmodels clearly outperform the time series models due to their\\nability to capture spatiotemporal dependencies. In summary,\\nthe proposed STD-MAE framework significantly advances\\nthe state-of-the-art in spatiotemporal forecasting, demonstrat-\\ning its ability to augment downstream predictors.\\n5.3 Ablation Study\\nMasking Ablation.

We first conduct hyperparameter study\\nby varying the masking ratio r in {0.25, 0.5, 0.75}, where\\nthe value is applied equally to S-MAE and T-MAE. As\\nshown by Figure 4, a masking ratio of 0.25 yields the low-\\nest error across all datasets, indicating optimal value. Prior\\nwork on masked language modeling with BERT[Kenton and\\nToutanova, 2019] utilizes a relatively low masking ratio of\\nonly 15% during pre-training.

We first conduct hyperparameter study\\nby varying the masking ratio r in {0.25, 0.5, 0.75}, where\\nthe value is applied equally to S-MAE and T-MAE. As\\nshown by Figure 4, a masking ratio of 0.25 yields the low-\\nest error across all datasets, indicating optimal value. Prior\\nwork on masked language modeling with BERT[Kenton and\\nToutanova, 2019] utilizes a relatively low masking ratio of\\nonly 15% during pre-training.

The model has a decoupled design, which means it separates the spatial and temporal aspects of the data, allowing it to learn features that are relevant to both aspects. The model also uses a masking technique, where a certain percentage of the data is randomly masked, and the model learns to reconstruct the missing data.

Vietnam has elected Luong Cuong, a military general, as its new president, the fourth official to fill the role in 18 months. Two of Vietnam's current four pillars of political power, General Secretary To Lam and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, were former security officials who held positions in the Ministry of Public Security. On Oct. 22, a ceremony was held at the Office of the President, where To Lam handed over the presidential duties to Cuong. BANGKOK (AP) — Vietnam's top security official To Lam was confirmed Wednesday as the nation's new president. He oversaw police and intelligence operations over a period when rights groups say basic liberties have been systematically suppressed, and its secret service was accused of violating international law. Lam was confirmed by Vietnam's National Assembly after his predecessor ... Luong Cuong, a prominent military leader, was elected as Vietnam's state president in 2024, bringing stability after a period of political change.\n"

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\"], [\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets.

The institute was inspired by the vision of the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh CSC, President Emeritus of the University of Notre Dame. The institute has contributed to international policy discussions about peace building practices.\"], ['The library system of the university is divided between the main library and each of the colleges and schools. The main building is the 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library, completed in 1963, which is the third building to house the main collection of books.

Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute. In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD in Gnotobiotics.\"], [\"The Lobund Institute grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began in 1928.

The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.\"], [\"The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name.
